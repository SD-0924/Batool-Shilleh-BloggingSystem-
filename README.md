### Blogging System with Sequelize - Ready File

**General Description:**

This project implements a backend RESTful API for a blogging system using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL. It allows users to create, categorize, and comment on posts. The project is built with TypeScript and uses Sequelize as the ORM to interact with the MySQL database. It follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and incorporates validation, authentication, and other services for handling CRUD operations. The relationships between users, posts, categories, and comments are established through Sequelize associations.

**Technologies Covered:**

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js**: The web framework for building APIs.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and improved developer experience.
- **Sequelize**: The ORM for interacting with MySQL databases.
- **MySQL**: The database used to store users, posts, categories, and comments.
- **JWT Authentication**: For securing the API endpoints.

### **Project Structure:**

- **Controllers**: Handle the logic for managing users, posts, comments, and categories.
- **Models**: Sequelize models for defining tables and relationships.
- **Repositories**: Encapsulate database queries and logic.
- **Middleware**: For authentication, validation, and error handling.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Routes**: Define API routes and connect them to controllers.
- **Utils**: Utility functions for tasks like password hashing, JWT signing, etc.
- **Tests**: Unit tests to ensure functionality works correctly.
- **Configuration**: Contains database and environment configurations.

### **General Instructions:**

1. **Set Up the Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project, install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Sequelize, Express, JWT), and set up TypeScript.
2. **Database Configuration**: Create a MySQL database and update the `config.ts` file to store the database connection details.
3. **Define Models and Relationships**: Create Sequelize models for `User`, `Post`, `Category`, and `Comment` with appropriate relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).
4. **API Routes Implementation**: Set up the routes for handling CRUD operations for users, posts, comments, and categories.
5. **Authentication**: Implement JWT authentication middleware for protecting certain routes.
6. **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests using Jest or Mocha for the CRUD operations and error handling.
7. **Docker**: Write Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize the application and deploy it.

### **Authentication:**

- **JWT Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication for secure access to API endpoints.
  - **Login**: On successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the user.
  - **Middleware**: Protect routes that require authentication by verifying the token.
